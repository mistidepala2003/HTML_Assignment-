    <p style="color:crimson; font-style: italic;">Step 1: In a large mixing bowl, add melted butter, milk, and Nestl√© MILKMAID and give it a good mix.
Step 2: Sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Mix everything until no large flour pockets are present in the batter. Transfer the cake batter into a lined 6-inch round pan.
Step 3: Prepare the cooker for steaming the cake by spreading some salt at the bottom of cooker and placing a small stand in the centre of it. Heat it at medium-low heat for 5-7 mins and then carefully place the round pan on the stand. Close the lid without the whistle and steam it for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.
Step 4: Take out the cake from the cooker and let it cool till it comes at room temperature.
Step 5: Once completely cooled, cling wrap it and chill in refrigerator for a few hours.
Step 6: Meanwhile, make the ganache and coffee soak. For the ganache, heat fresh cream and bring it to a simmer.
Step 7: Pour it over dark chocolate and then mix to combine until chocolate melts completely and you get a smooth ganache. For the coffee soak, simple mix coffee powder with water till coffee dissolves.
Step 8: Cut 2 layers of the cake using a sharp serrated knife.
Step 9: Soak the first layer of cake with the coffee soak and spread the ganache over it.
Step 10: Top it with the second layer of cake and repeat the process.</p>
